In the chaos of 2010 it fell to the Tories again. The Tories held it in 2015 as the LibDem vote disappeared as a result of the insanity of Clegg and his Orange Bookers. <!--1329339967450083328-->

It has a fairly typical electoral history since 1983 when it has held by a Liberal. It then fell to the Tories in 87 and was held by them in 92.
