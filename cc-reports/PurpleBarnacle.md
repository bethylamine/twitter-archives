* [26 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220826200541/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1563256238325915651): Love this.  Sheku Kanneh-Mason - Leonard Cohen: Hallelujah, arr. Tom Hodge <!--1563256238325915651-->

The LGB can only be allies to the TQ+, and shouldn't attend if we centre our orientation rather that the identities of others. We have to respect those who erase us in other words. <!--1563209016888930306-->
* [26 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220826125953/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1563066449723199488): Great little informative thread on de Beauvoir, with some historical context. <!--1563066449723199488-->
* [26 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220826073032/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1563065668932890626): As you say, rights conflict. The only way forward is to find solutions that work for all, such as additional spaces, so that everyone's needs and rights are met. There's no other way. <!--1563065668932890626-->
* [25 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220825182831/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1562869263995510788): This seems like a considerable step in the right direction - 60 feminist organisations denouncing prostitution, porn, surrogacy, the erasure of sex in favour of gender, and more. Great little manifesto. <!--1562869263995510788-->
* [25 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220825201325/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1562867074422059009): üíú I had no idea the police were so far behind technologically. <!--1562867074422059009-->

* [24 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220824174322/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1562476892292141056): You're transing the gay away, not honouring him for who he was. He would never have supported the idea that same-sex attraction doesn't exist or is bigoted. LGB history is not yours to rewrite. <!--1562476892292141056-->

Hopefully that will mean more time for research ü§û <!--1553493703708262400-->

It's a work in progress and any suggestion is welcome. <!--1551271551579967491-->

* [24 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220724181109/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1551132710873305089): Happy anniversary to you both! <!--1551132710873305089-->

That‚Äôs how much sense it makes to me. <!--1551116785742667776-->
* [24 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220725185033/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1551114998927310849): Absolutely! <!--1551114998927310849-->

* [23 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220723225136/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550959770676432904): Not only do I not understand Butler, I don‚Äôt understand those explaining what Butler means ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <!--1550959770676432904-->

She simply said that there are occasions when women need single-sex spaces, and that we should have the right to self-determination. That's literally it. <!--1550770857508802560-->
* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722211059/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550588869204213762): What a time to be studying astronomy ü§© <!--1550588869204213762-->

* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722213732/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550580870188244993): Or metaphorical eggs. I've so going to savour that day after all the stuff they've put us through. <!--1550580870188244993-->
* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722213732/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550580870188244993): This whole mess is giving misogynists a way to appear progressive. Interesting to see how far they're willing to go. <!--1550575885102759938-->
* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722213732/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550580870188244993): tl;dr "I hate women" <!--1550529213752840192-->

Maybe it's an accumulation of things but it's upsetting me more than I thought it would. <!--1550425825979285505-->
* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722100011/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550420362336370688): Judging by the replies they're getting, they must realise it's not a winning strategy. <!--1550420362336370688-->
* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722094455/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550416472819761153): We invented that fact, remember? Then imposed it on everyone when we colonised the world. <!--1550416472819761153-->
* [22 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722091450/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550408914889572353): They substituted my fresh broccoli with cauliflower cheese once. Even the delivery guy was embarrassed. <!--1550408914889572353-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722105002/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550218525352017921): Reading up on We Are Everywhere, an exhibition that looks as lesbians in archives. The curator says that "to be a lesbian is to be a historian" because we record our own lives. Looking forward to researching this a bit more. <!--1550218525352017921-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721193141/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550196918835417088): So no T only charities either? No more Mermaids? <!--1550196918835417088-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721210809/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550188437097091072): When do the kids go back to school? <!--1550188437097091072-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721165706/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550162760729780237): That‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre doing. <!--1550162760729780237-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721163256/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550156439901163523): These lesbian-only groups are hated because they're small acts of resistance. They're about putting our wellbeing, our interests and our sisterhood first. It's anathema to systems that seek to divide us. <!--1550156439901163523-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721135243/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550116278718722049): Maybe it's because it's not coming from gender ideologues. I don't really notice that anymore. <!--1550116278718722049-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721133009/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550110720632561665): Is it bash-a-lesbian day again? It seems to be all over my TL. Thankful for all those pushing back. <!--1550110720632561665-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721093043/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550050316015378432): Queer progress - removing a woman from her creation because she's guilty of Thoughtcrime. The cringe is something else, for many reasons. <!--1550050316015378432-->
* [21 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220721073634/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1550021840655073284): Will have everything crossed for you ü§û <!--1550021840655073284-->
* [20 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720214056/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549871720701595648): I'm sorry she didn't take your arguments on board. Her anti-racism work is important, and you've spoken about the problems you sometimes face with straight Black women and within the lesbian community. Another kick in the teeth. Solidarity üíú <!--1549871720701595648-->
* [20 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720214056/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549871720701595648): I just checked who it was. I made that point to her a few years ago and she blocked me. It's pure hypocrisy as well as blatant lesbophobia. <!--1549867688666828800-->
* [20 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720135357/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549754382417379329): This is a little gem of a discussion. If you haven't already, do yourself a favour and watch it. Both uplifting and inspiring, can't recommend it enough üíú <!--1549754382417379329-->
* [19 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719140915/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549395715616653319): You blame us because you don't "approve" of our "lifestyle" - that's what makes you a homophobe. <!--1549395715616653319-->
* [19 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719140915/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549395715616653319): No, Lorraine. We're here because mostly straight men hijacked the LGB movement and turned it into this nightmare. Lesbians have been calling this out for decades. You would have noticed had you not been so worried about our "lifestyle". And here we are. <!--1549394238777053187-->
* [19 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719092502/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549324270374981633): In a crowded field, this has got to be one of the worst. Woman does the job without dehumanising us. <!--1549324270374981633-->
* [19 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719072508/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549293828565254145): Only women are being denied that right when mixed-sex spaces replace female-only spaces, and then face threats, intimidation and even violence when fighting to retain female-only spaces. <!--1549293828565254145-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719020907/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549151102389583879): The T and LGB are not the same. It‚Äôs mostly straight blokes pushing the TQ+ BS. Take it up with them, we‚Äôve been warning people about this for decades. <!--1549151102389583879-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220718214958/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549138627854204932): Gay men have never demanded access to our spaces. Try again. <!--1549138627854204932-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220718220600/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549138042660786179): Women‚Äôs safety isn‚Äôt a culture war, you obnoxious fool. Until you‚Äôve sorted out the problem of male violence, we‚Äôll carry on needing safe spaces. So off you pop - get back to us when it‚Äôs done. <!--1549138042660786179-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719185741/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549119157626617859): I'm seeing more and more of these. Even LGB people claiming they wouldn't have fought for our rights if they'd known this would be the outcome. Apparently the "slippery slope" argument had merit. It's frustrating. <!--1549119157626617859-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220718235048/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549106753433903104): Wake up. It's a protection racket. <!--1549106753433903104-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720083650/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549104700334546944): Men can't be trusted, Matthew. That's why we segregate by sex. <!--1549104700334546944-->

I get that for many men, women's rights don't matter but we're seeing rapists and other predatory men committing sexual violence against girls as young as 10 and women because they claim they're women. <!--1549103327610376194-->
* [18 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220718173115/https://twitter.com/PurpleBarnacle/status/1549068795670679552): I fundamentally disagree with this. Lesbians were the first ones to try to warn others decades ago and were ignored. PIE and other attempts to attach themselves to our movement predate us getting our rights. This mess is caused by straight men. <!--1549068795670679552-->

If you're sure of your position, put your evidence out there and let others do the same. Distorting, deflecting, denying - not a good look. <!--1517835746455035906-->

I reject the idea of gender identity because I consider it regressive and homophobic. People believe otherwise, and that's fine. They can identify as they please.

The type of gamete you produce determines whether you're male or female.

I suspect there are a number of factors at play - fear of being shunned/harassed by your community/support system, beliefs that we're just hateful bigots, etc. Is she part of any LGBT group? <!--1432266676721102848-->

The only consolation is that more and more people are waking up to this nightmare but while they only target lesbians and gay men I don't think much will change. <!--1432262830540066817-->

We're already had assaults and countless threats. Are we going to have to wait until someone is seriously hurt or worse? I guess we can only hope that this raises awareness. <!--1431965267895234564-->

We saw similar things with lesbians at previous Pride events. This is happening because too many people fail to condemn the intimidating and violent behaviours of TAs and their allies, and instead target those who are raising concerns. <!--1431964809608765441-->

That's why people are challenging it, not because we're bigots. <!--1431565009163800584-->

What's always left out here is that many of us who are LGB and T oppose Stonewall because it's stopped representing us and instead it focuses on an ideology that's both homophobic and misogynistic. People need to stop ignoring this. <!--1431563938488008706-->

We receive all sorts of violent threats, are harassed, lose our jobs, etc. when we mention our experiences and needs. Have *you* contemplated any of this? Your bias is extraordinary. <!--1431251286675034115-->

It frustrates me that we get smeared as hateful by those who choose to ignore the homophobia we're subjected to. I've given up on the idea that it will end any time soon.

It would be nice to see you engage in good faith with all the people who are trying to explain to you what the situation is.

It's very clear that you not only don't support our rights, you also actively work to erode them by arguing for mixed-sex spaces and sport. Against our will. You smear us because it allows you to deflect. <!--1430840448218771464-->

The Equality Act 2010 allows for single-sex spaces because it acknowledges our unique needs. Our position isn't anti-trans - it's about keeping those who are male out of female spaces irrespective of identity. <!--1430542648608178180-->

When you dig and dig and dig you eventually find what you're looking for. Cherry pick what you want and tada! You have your intersection.

You can frame it as anti-trans, it's a waste of time and virtually no one believes you anymore.

A reddit subgroup as almost 20,000 detransitioners - this suggests a large enough group to raise concerns.  I'm pushing for proper assessment and support, which many aren't getting.

And I think the threats are also getting worse because they're far less effective than they used to be - more and more people are speaking up and challenging the ideology.

It's about acknowledging that sex, and not gender identity, is a protected characteristic in the Equality Act 2010. <!--1401595461111275520-->

They could still get married, and their marriage could still be about procreation. <!--1381236039042404355-->

They can call themselves bi, queer, pan, or create a new term. Because the term lesbian is taken. <!--1379061780555702283-->

In many ways, where things are so polarised in countries like the UK, it's quite counter-productive.

Not after vilifying us for years. I don't expect anything from him. It's enough that more and more people see him for who he is. There will always be some to defend him, but that's not sustainable. <!--1378822623300362240-->

He was challenged for the language he used and his hypocrisy.

Every time he's called out on his misogyny, he frames such criticism as homophobia or transphobia and it works for him. We're smeared and discredited, and our points get lost in all the noise.

OJ is acting like any criticism of his demeaning language and hypocrisy is homophobic and transphobic, which allows him to avoid confronting his long history of misogyny and lesbophobia.

But I note again that this derails from the arguments we're making, as always.

OJ was challenged because of the demeaning language he used, and the fact that he's spent years gaslighting lesbians when in fact he understands full well the importance of sex.

Delusions of Gender and Testosterone Rex, both by Cordelia Fine. Inferior by Angela Saini. The Gendered Brain by Gina Rippon.

It would be so much easier for them to accept that sex and gender ID aren't the same thing and therefore require different protections.

A ten-year long fight to have the crimes recognised as rape. <!--1359453679410118657-->

I don't think it's unusual to feel like you do. For some people it's quite straightforward, for others it takes longer - it's something you have to come to terms with. <!--1354086727661584385-->

Sexual orientations exclude groups of people (unless bi of course), and that's absolutely fine. They argue that the term homosexual is problematic so we have to use a word that erases homosexuality itself, meaning we have no word to describe ourselves. <!--1354059597527572486-->

It's so relentless right now, and it's so important that we counter the absurd idea that a man can just declare himself a lesbian. For the sake of young lesbians.

In their rush to condemn anything to do with the Keira Bell ruling, they've had nothing to say about the harm caused to Keira.

Ideologues seem to have turned their attention to VSCs recently. <!--1330957603191578630-->

We are same-sex attracted, this doesn't change because of what goes on in someone else's mind. But then you do like your conspiracy theories, don't you? <!--1330956663646527491-->

Lesbians understood this decades ago but were ignored, I suspect in part as a result of misogyny and homophobia. It can also probably explain why gender ID ideology has been left unchallenged by so many. <!--1330946043949817857-->

I know, and that's the whole point - you being trans*gender* doesn't change your sex. Just say that you want to remove sex-based rights - it's both clear and honest, unlike your ideology. <!--1328671405534289921-->

You've already condemned us and you're going to cherry pick whatever fits the conclusion you've already reached.  Many trans people agree with JKR.

It's ridiculous to claim so.  I don't want mixed-sex spaces. So yes, when you no longer segregate changing rooms, etc. on the basis of sex, I lose my rights to safety, dignity and privacy. <!--1328045050920570880-->

There's no such thing as a lesbian with a penis or "girldick". You could so easily choose another term rather than something that you can't materially be.

They're parents to two teenagers and they're horrified by what's going on. Such a relief when it happens. I think mostly people don't realise.

If anyone can be a woman or lesbian then all we're left with is the material reality of sexed bodies. They call us vagina owners yet criticise us for referring to our bodies. It's so insidious. <!--1326483512740950016-->

These conditions, however, never produce a third gamete.   Gender identity ideology is as scientific as creationism. We don't need it to support trans people. <!--1326127921740845063-->

Each human produces one of two gametes in the absence of medical conditions.

But the reality is that lesbians get labelled TERFs and vilified for saying no to TW. As if the material reality of sex no longer matters when it comes to our sexual orientation. And it's almost always lesbians targeted, not gay or straight men. <!--1325804724558434304-->

Just rolled my eyes at this blatant attempt to manipulate.  I hate how our objecting to an ideology is framed as hatred. It's all about control and power, and does nothing to address the issues faced by trans people. <!--1325562756280487939-->

I don't have to believe transwomen are women to treat them with respect and defend their rights. Disagreeing with an ideology is not the same as bigotry.

It's always interesting to see claims of "inclusivity" from people who refuse to include the words that matter to us. It's very easy to use mothers and other birthing parents. The misogyny in erasing us is clear. <!--1320347967811964928-->

It's about the countless women who've lost their jobs, who've been threatened or even assaulted, etc. Those men now attacking RD are always very silent when it comes to what we're subjected to.

No. I said there are procedures and we need to follow them. But nice evasion again - why are you not asking those who are harassing and threatening RD be held accountable for their actions?

Gender identity doesn't miraculously remove the physical advantages of male athletes. It's fine to encourage any athlete to take part but not at the expense of women.

What bothers me, besides the abandonment of science and common sense, is framing the protection of women's safety and rights as anti-trans.

You're deflecting, like all misogynists, from the abuse JKR got for defending women's rights. Because of course people aren't condemning criticism, they're condemning abuse.

Because we know that in places where prostitution has been decriminalised or legalised, which the women in your case tend to support, there is more trafficking, violence, etc. There seems to be some dissonance at play in their minds. <!--1308745067440504835-->

Radical feminism in these debates focuses on the most marginalised women, highlighting the issues of violence and exploitation. Something that leftie men would normally agree with incidentally.

You only have to look at men's and women's results to see why we need separate categories. Just as age, weight, etc. also deserve their own categories.
