When Democrats get in power they don‚Äôt even undo all the damage.  Republicans in 2005 passed a bill designed to kill the post office.  Obama left it in place.

They also built the concentration camps and put refugee kids in cages to try and intimidate parents so they wouldn‚Äôt send kids to America. <!--1282769231780569089-->
